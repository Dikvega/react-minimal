# react-minimal-full-stack

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Dikvega/react-minimal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Dikvega/react-minimal)

This is a boilerplate to build a full stack web application using React, Node.js, Express and Webpack. It is also configured with webpack-dev-server, eslint, and babel.

Inspiration and guidance for setting this up came from [Simple-react-full-stack](https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack).
